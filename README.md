- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Stas ^^ a neurodivergent cuddly non binary cat monster [they/it/any, gray ace]
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming [mostly compiled], Minecraft [mostly modded], and FFXIV [mostly SGE & GNB]
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and C++, definitely want to try writing Minecraft mods, might try web stuff sometime
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - @StasTG on Telegram or @Scuffy#0243 on Discord

I did a bunch of C/C++ while at school, some multi-threading stuff and some GUI stuff with SDL, admittedly not very advanced.

I only recently got a dx and it's been a rough 21 years. I've been on hiatus for a while, but I think things are gonna turn around soon, so I'm trying to get back into it and maybe start a degree apprenticeship or something this year.
